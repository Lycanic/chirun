You can use the Chirun web frontend without creating an account.

On the index page, click :guilabel:`Create a new package`.

Upload your source file(s), and click :guilabel:`Create`.

You are shown the configuration form for your package.
If you uploaded a :file:`config.yml` file, the form is already filled in with the values from that file, otherwise it begins blank and you must fill out the package's structure.

Once you have saved the configuration, the package is built.
Click on :guilabel:`View the generated content` to go to the package's :ref:`management page <web-package-management>`.

Access to the package is granted only by knowing the address of this page, so make sure to bookmark it.
The URL is shown at the top of the management page so you can copy it.
