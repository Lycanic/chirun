Using Chirun through LTI
########################

The Chirun web frontend is an `LTI 1.3 tool <http://www.imsglobal.org/activity/learning-tools-interoperability>`__. 

You can use this tool to link to and manage material from your learning environment.

***************
Creating a link
***************

In Moodle, select the Chirun activity type, or "external tool", and select the Chirun preconfigured tool.

Click :guilabel:`Select content`.
A modal frame opens.

You can see all packages linked to this context.

You can select a linked package to use, create a new package, or import a package created in another context by giving its :ref:`management URL <package-management-url>`.

Once you've selected a package, if it offers more than one theme, you're asked to pick a theme.

Then you must pick an item.
When the student opens this link, they will see the item you select.
They may be able to navigate to other parts of the package, depending on how the item is configured.

If the item is available in more than one HTML format, then you must finally pick the format to use.

Click :guilabel:`Use this choice` to confirm your choice.
You'll be returned to your learning environment.
