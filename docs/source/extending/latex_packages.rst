LaTeX package support
#####################

Chirun uses the `PlasTeX compiler <https://github.com/plastex/plastex>`__ to parse LaTeX documents. Not all LaTeX packages are supported by PlasTeX, but more can be added by implementing them in Python.

If this is something you are interested in pursuing, see the `PlasTeX Documentation on Macros and Packages <http://plastex.github.io/plastex/plastex/sec-macros.html>`_ to learn more.
