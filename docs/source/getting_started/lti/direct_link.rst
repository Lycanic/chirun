Direct Linking
==============

By default, when a learner clicks a Chriun LTI item with multiple pieces of content available they are first directed
to an introduction page. As an alternative, a piece of content can be set as "direct linked". Direct linked items are
shown to the learner when they first enter the LTI item via the VLE, instead of the introduction page.

This setting is useful when you have several LTI items pointing to the same piece of uploaded content (through use of
the content GUID). The same content can be associated with several LTI items, but by direct linking to different content,
each item displaying a different piece of content when accessed by learners. 

.. warning::
   Direct linking does not prevent learners accessing other content associated with the LTI item. To restrict access
   to content, use :ref:`Adaptive Release`.
