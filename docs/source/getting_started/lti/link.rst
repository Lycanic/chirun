Link to Existing Content
----------------------------

Once you have uploaded content to the Chirun LTI Provider, the same content can be linked to different LTI items.
This is useful when combining with :ref:`Direct Linking` so that several LTI items point to the same piece of
uploaded content, but with each LTI item displaying a different piece of content when accessed by learners. 

To link an empty Chirun LTI item to existing content, you will need to know the GUID code for the content.
The GUID for existing content can be found on the "Selected Content" dashboard page of the LTI item where they
have been successfuly uploaded.

Once you know the GUID,

 * Scroll down the Upload page to the "Existsing Document" section.

 * Enter an existing GUID in the box labelled "GUID"

 * Finally, click "Submit"

Existing content must have been uploaded by the same user currently logged in.
